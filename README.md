# Open Profile

Unified profile to showcase your work.

We dream of a time when recruiters will not ask for a resume. Instead, they will ask for your Open Profile ID. Open Profile will become the standard for sharing your professional profile. It will be the first thing you share with a recruiter, a potential employer, a potential client, a potential partner, a potential investor, a potential co-founder, a potential employee, a potential collaborator, a potential customer, a potential anything.

Read more about the idea [here](ABOUT.md).

## How it works

The app will fetch your data from different sources and display them in a single page.

Currently we fetch data from:

- GitHub
- Data from a JSON file created by the user

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thtauhid/open-profile
cd open-profile
npm install
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

```bash
npm run build
```

## Development

Currently, we are following this [wireframe](Wireframe.pdf) for the UI.
